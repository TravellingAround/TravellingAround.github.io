            The Great Sphinx of Giza is a limestone statue of a reclining
            sphinx, a mythical creature with the head of a human and the body of
            a lion. Facing directly from west to east, it stands on the Giza
            Plateau on the west bank of the Nile in Giza, Egypt. The face of the
            Sphinx appears to represent the pharaoh Khafre. The original shape
            of the Sphinx was cut from the bedrock, and has since been restored
            with layers of limestone blocks. It measures 73 m (240 ft) long from
            paw to tail, 20 m (66 ft) high from the base to the top of the head
            and 19 m (62 ft) wide at its rear haunches.

            The Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest Egyptian pyramid and served
            as the tomb of pharaoh Khufu, who ruled during the Fourth Dynasty of
            the Old Kingdom. Built in the early 26th century BC, over a period
            of about 27 years,the pyramid is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of
            the Ancient World, and the only wonder that has remained largely
            intact. It is the most famous monument of the Giza pyramid complex,
            which is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site "Memphis and its
            Necropolis".It is situated at the northern end of the line of the
            three pyramids at Giza.

          <p>
            The Luxor Temple (Arabic: معبد الأقصر) is a large Ancient Egyptian
            temple complex located on the east bank of the Nile River in the
            city today known as Luxor (ancient Thebes) and was constructed
            approximately 1400 BCE. In the Egyptian language it was known as
            ipet resyt, "the southern sanctuary". It was one of the two primary
            temples on the east bank, the other being Karnak. Unlike the other
            temples in Thebes, Luxor temple is not dedicated to a cult god or a
            deified version of the pharaoh in death. Instead, Luxor temple is
            dedicated to the rejuvenation of kingship; it may have been where
            many of the pharaohs of Egypt were crowned in reality or
            conceptually (as in the case of Alexander the Great, who claimed he
            was crowned at Luxor but may never have traveled south of Memphis,
            near modern Cairo).

            The Museum of Egyptian Antiquities, commonly known as the Egyptian
            Museum,also called the Cairo Museum, located in Cairo, Egypt, houses
            the largest collection of Egyptian antiquities in the world. It
            houses over 120,000 items, with a representative amount on display.

            Tutankhamun's treasure, including its iconic gold burial mask,

            and a prominent symbol of ancient Egypt.
