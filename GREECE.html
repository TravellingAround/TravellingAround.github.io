          <p>
            The Acropolis of Athens is an ancient citadel located on a rocky
            outcrop above the city of Athens, Greece, and contains the remains
            of several ancient buildings of great architectural and historical
            significance, the most famous being the Parthenon. The word
            Acropolis is from the Greek words ἄκρον (akron, "highest point,
            extremity") and πόλις (polis, "city").The term acropolis is generic
            and there are many other acropoleis in Greece. During ancient times
            the Acropolis of Athens was also more properly known as Cecropia,
            after the legendary serpent-man Cecrops, the supposed first Athenian
            king.While there is evidence that the hill was inhabited as early as
            the fourth millennium BC, it was Pericles (c.495-429 BC) in the
            fifth century BC who coordinated the construction of the buildings
            whose present remains are the site's most important ones, including
            the Parthenon, the Propylaea, the Erechtheion and the Temple of
            Athena Nike.

            Santorini (Greek: Σαντορίνη) is an island ring composed of a group
            of volcanoes in the Aegean Sea, 200 kilometers southeast of the
            Greek mainland, located between 36.40° north latitude and 25.40°
            east longitude. The largest island in the Santorini ring is also
            called Santorini, also known as Thera (Θήρα). Santorini is located
            at the southernmost tip of the Cyclades Islands, covering an area of
            about 73 square kilometers and a population of about 14,000 people,
            mostly Greeks. "Santorini" was named by the Venetians in the 13th
            century, originating from Saint Irene (Italian: Santa Irene); before
            that, the island was called Thera, Kalisti (Καλλίστη, in ancient
            Greece Meaning "the most beautiful") or Strongiri (Στρογγύλη). The
            buildings on the island are blue and white, set against the blue
            sea, and are so beautiful that it is a famous tourist attraction.
            Administratively, Santorini belongs to the state of Thera.

          <p>
            The Meteora (Greek: Μετέωρα) is a rock formation in the regional
            unit of Trikala, in Thessaly, Greece, hosting one of the largest and
            most precipitously built complexes of Eastern Orthodox monasteries,
            second in importance only to Mount Athos.The six (of an original
            twenty-four) monasteries are built on immense natural pillars and
            hill-like rounded boulders that dominate the local area. Between the
            13th and 14th centuries, the twenty-four monasteries were
            established atop the rocks.Meteora is located near the town of
            Kalabaka at the northwestern edge of the Plain of Thessaly near the
            Pineios river and Pindus Mountains.

            Cephalonia is the site of the most visited section of the Kefalonia,
            located in the Ionian Sea, is the largest island in the Ionian
            Islands. The name of the island is believed to come from the ancient
            Greek mythological hero Cephalus (Κέφαλος). The island is famous as
            the home of Odysseus in Homer's Odyssey, who calls him "King of the
            Cephalonians". The story background of the best-selling novel and
            movie of the same name "Captain Corelli's Mandolin" (also translated
            as "War Lovers") is also set on the island that was occupied by the
            Germans during World War II. Today, the island's beautiful beaches
            and caves attract many tourists every year to spend their summers.
