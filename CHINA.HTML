            Badaling (simplified Chinese: 八达岭;) is the site of the most
            visited section of the Great Wall of China, approximately 80
            kilometers (50 mi) northwest of Beijing's city center, in Badaling
            Town, Yanqing District, Beijing municipality. The portion of the
            wall running through the site was built in 1504 during the Ming
            Dynasty, along with a military outpost reflecting the location's
            strategic importance. The highest point of Badaling is Beibalou
            (北八樓), approximately 1,015 meters (3,330 ft) above sea level.
            Badaling Great Wall was built in the Ming Dynasty (1505) to occupy a
            commanding and strategic position for protecting the Juyongguan Pass
            (Juyongguan section of the Great Wall) to its south, further
            protecting the city of Beijing.The portion of the wall at Badaling
            has undergone restoration, and in 1957, it was the first section of
            the wall to open to tourism.Now visited annually by millions, the
            immediate area has seen significant development, including hotels,
            restaurants, and a cable car.

            Wulingyuan (Chinese: 武陵源) is a scenic and historical site in the
            Wulingyuan District of South Central China's Hunan Province. It was
            inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1992. It is noted for
            more than 3,000 quartzite sandstone pillars and peaks across most of
            the site, many over 200 metres (660 ft) in height, along with many
            ravines and gorges with picturesque streams, pools, lakes, rivers,
            and waterfalls. It features 40 caves, many with large calcite
            deposits and a natural bridge named Tianqiashengkong (meaning
            'bridge across the sky'), which is one of the highest natural
            bridges in the world. The site also provides habitat for many
            vulnerable species, including the dhole, Asiatic black bear, and
            Chinese water deer.

            West Lake (Chinese: 西湖) is a freshwater lake in Hangzhou, China.
            It is divided into five sections by three causeways. There are
            numerous temples, pagodas, gardens, and natural/artificial islands
            within the lake. Gushan (孤山) is the largest natural island and
            three artificial islands: Xiaoyingzhou (小瀛洲), Huixin Pavilion
            (湖心亭), and Ruan Gongdun (阮公墩) stand at the middle of the lake.
            Leifeng Pagoda (雷峰塔) and Baochu Pagoda (保俶塔) are separated by
            the lake. Mirroring each other, the basic pattern of "one mountain,
            two towers, three islands, three banks, and five lakes" is
            formed.West Lake has influenced poets and painters throughout
            Chinese history for its natural beauty and historic relics, and it
            has also been among the most important sources of inspiration for
            Chinese garden designers.It was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in
            2011, described as having "influenced garden design in the rest of
            China as well as Japan and Korea over the centuries"and reflecting
            "an idealized fusion between humans and nature".
